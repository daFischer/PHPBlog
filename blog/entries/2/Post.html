A few things I forgot to mention as features to come:
<ul>
	<li>
		Database in the backend. Right now I'm just loading from the filesystem.
		I'm not sure about how uploads should be done, though. Since many free 
		webhosts don't have https (000webhost neither).
	</li>
	<li>
		A search field on the left or in the header,
		where you can search for posts by tags.
	</li>
	<li>
		Tags themselves!
		This is tied in with having the database running. I wouldn't try to
		simulate that one with just the filesystem.
	</li>
	<li>
		A post history, where posts can be opened by publishing date. It would
		also be possible to view all posts of a chosen month or something like
		it.
	</li>
	<li>
		I'll probably come up with something to fill the right side of the page
		as well. Newest Twitter posts? Favorite sites? There's so many options
		:D
	</li>
	<li>
		A way of testing new posts offline, so nobody's able to sneak a peek at
		unpublished posts.
		This should be done pretty easily  by creating a PageBuilder.js that
		copies PageBuilder.php. Keeping both in sync might become a hassle
		though. No solutions for that, yet.
	</li>
</ul>

It would probably be too early to talk about this blog's structure now, since
there's a few issues waiting to be fixed. index.php is a mess and I'm not using
Inversion of Control
<a href="http://www.phptherightway.com/#dependency_injection"> (explanation)</a>
anywhere. There's not many places for the latter to be used, yet, but it'll
probably make things easier down the road.
