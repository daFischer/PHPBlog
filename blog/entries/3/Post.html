Let's review the progress since the first post (since I haven't posted in a while):
<ul>
	<li>
		Images can be shown (like in <a href="/blog/post?id=2">Post 2</a>)
	</li>
	<li>
		The headlines link to a page only showing the post they belong to
	</li>
	<li>
		The Footer has a bit more content (GitHub Link)
	</li>
	<li>
		The CSS has had a lot of tiny improvements, like changing the header
		and footer color from orange to violet and increasing a few margins
	</li>
	<li>
		There's a database backend now, although uploading is still somewhat of
		a hassle, since https is impossible and I don't want to send unencrypted
		passwords.
	</li>
</ul>
Next on the "ToDo" list are an offline tool with which posts can be tested before
uploading them and the tag system (for which there's already a bit in the
database)

University is going to keep me busy as well, so these updates might not come as
fast as I expect them to.
