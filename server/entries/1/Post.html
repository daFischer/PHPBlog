Heureka!<br>
Posting blog entries already works :)<br>
<br>
Alright then, let's get some kind of roadmap in here.
<h4>What's done already</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		I can post blog entries (as HTML file) complete with their own JS and CSS files
		These 3 files (per post) are combined server side, the readers won't even notice.
	</li>
	<li>
		The CSS file is loaded as a scoped style element, so it only affects whatever post it's loaded for.
	</li>
	<li>
		It works without needing any JS, so those of you prefering to use NoScript won't have any problems ;)
		Some posts might be showing JavaScript, though.
		Since this is a blog mainly about WebDev that kinda can't be avoided.
	</li>
	<li>
		All requests to .../blog/... are redirected to .../blog/index.php where the visible sites are created from several template HTML files.
		This allows for centralized Page Building, avoiding the dreaded Spaghetti code.
	</li>
	<li>
		Right now there are only two sites, this one and another, hidden one.<br>
		Can you find it?
		<p class="hidden">
			Oh no!<br>
			<a href="http://stratecide.uphero.com/blog/test">You found it ;)</a><br>
			This is where I'm testing whether the newest uploaded post breaks the site before publishing it.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>What's to come</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		Uploading other files, like images doesn't work yet.
		More accurately, they can be uploaded but index.php doesn't allow loading them. This won't take long to fix, though.
	</li>
	<li>
		The headline over posts will link to the post it belongs to, allowing readers to bookmark specific posts.
	</li>
	<li>
		Header and Footer are practically empty right now.
		Something about me and a link to this blog's repo spring to mind as things that could be added there.
	</li>
	<li>
		Maybe an RSS feed?
		That's low priority as it's doubtful whether people are even interested in reading this blog.<br>
		We'll see.
	</li>
</ul>
This is all I could think of for now.
I'm kinda happy that it got this far within a few days :).

As soon as I can display images, I'll explain more in depth about how I structured the blog.
